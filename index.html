<p align="justify">
The Treebank Semantics Parsed Corpus (abbreviated TSPC)
is a corpus of English
with hand worked tree analysis for approaching half-a-million words.
Highlights include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>labelled constituent structure
<li>assignments of grammatical function
<li>inclusion of verb codes
<li>information to resolve anaphoric dependencies
</ul>

<p align="justify">
Further results &mdash; notably, dependency graphs &mdash; derived from the analysis
can be seen with the search interface.
</p>

<h2>A brief history</h2>

<p align="justify">
Construction of the TSPC has been ongoing since 2012.
The corpus was started as a sister corpus to the <a href="https://kainoki.github.io/">Kainoki treebank</a> for Japanese
(then the Keyaki treebank).
Since its inception,
the corpus has formed a testing ground for
the <a href="http://www.compling.jp/ajb129/ts.html">Treebank Semantics</a> method of
processing constituency tree annotations to return logic based meaning representations.
Forming the base input for reaching a database of meaning representations remains a major application of the corpus,
but also the corpus has grown into a resource for general use.
</p>

<h2>About the annotation</h2>

<p align="justify">
There is a <a href="guide.html">Parsing Guide</a> that describes the annotation scheme in detail.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The corpus,
while on a smaller scale,
is comparable to the resources
of the <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42">Penn Treebank</a> (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993),
<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice.htm">Parsed ICE Corpora</a> (Nelson, Wallis, and Aarts, 2002),
and the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/">Penn Historical Parsed Corpora</a> (Santorini, 2016).
The annotation is most relatable to
the <a href="https://www.grsampson.net/RSue.html">SUSANNE Corpus and Analytic Scheme</a> (Sampson, 1995),
and a large percentage (nearly three quarters)
of the data was converted from annotation
that had been following the SUSANNE scheme.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Differentiating factors of the current resource
are the richness of disambiguation information contained,
and the high degree of normalised structure present.
Both of these properties assist
the automatic creation of meaning representations.
</p>

<h2>Search Interface</h2>

<p align="justify">
The TSPC is associated with a powerful user <b><a href="https://oncoj.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/tspc.sh">interface</a></b>
that enables search using virtually any aspect of the annotation.
Results of specific searches can be downloaded in the form of annotated data.
The source data to which the search interface links is being updated constantly to reflect improvements in analysis.
</p>

<p align="justify">

<h2>Using the corpus for advanced research</h2>

<p align="justify">
The available on-line interface is a powerful and flexible tool sufficient for many research purposes, but note that the data on which it operates is updated in real time.
For extended research projects it is often advisable to download a release version for use off-line.
This not only provides the advanced researcher a stable set of data,
but also allows for manipulation of the data to reflect analyses that are not included in the present online corpus
but are necessary for a given research project.
</p>

<h2>Data formats</h2>

<p align="justify">
The working data format of the TSPC is a tabled Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format,
which is interchangeable with the bracketed format required by <a href="http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/CS-manual/YourCorpus.html">CorpusSearch</a>.
Both CSV and bracketed formats are available for download.
</p>

<h2>Mistakes</h2>

<p align="justify">
As with any annotated text corpus, there are mistakes in the TSPC.
The corpus is ongoing work and is under continuous improvement and correction.
Mistakes will be corrected as they become apparent and as time allows.
We will be grateful to be made aware of mistakes and will endeavour to eliminate them with the help of users (<a href="contact.html">contact</a>).
