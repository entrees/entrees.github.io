<h1>Main verbs</h1>

<br><h2><a name="sec7.1">7.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify">The <b>main verb</b> is either the only verb of a clause or the last verb to occur in a sequence of verbs of the same clause. Verbs of a verb sequence that are prior to the main verb, called <b>catenative verbs</b>, were the focus of chapter <a href="chapter6.html#ch6">6</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main verb of a clause determines which constituents (if any, besides the subject) are required for the clause to be structurally complete. With the annotation, these clause requirements are signalled by adding a code to the word class tag of each main verb. The system of codes used to mark main verbs comes from the fourth edition of the <i>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</i> (OALD4; Cowie 1989). These codes can add information that would be unavailable otherwise: Notably, they:</p>

<ul>
<li>signal when adverbial elements are selected items of the clause</li>
<li>disambiguate the subject contribution for passivised verbs (e.g., with [Tnt] the promoted subject has <tt>-DOB1</tt> function, while with [Dn.t] it has <tt>-OB2</tt> function)</li>
<li>partially establish word sense</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Also, the codes:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide a succinct notation to assist cataloging and searching clause structure</li>
<li>offer an independent check on the validity of the clause annotation</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The chapter is organised as follows. Section <a href="chapter7.html#sec7.2">7.2</a> gives an overview of the OALD4 codes. Thereafter each code is described and illustrated, with:</p>

<ul>
<li>section <a href="chapter7.html#sec7.3">7.3</a> covering linking verb codes</li>
<li>section <a href="chapter7.html#sec7.4">7.4</a>, intransitive verb codes</li>
<li>section <a href="chapter7.html#sec7.5">7.5</a>, monotransitive verb codes</li>
<li>section <a href="chapter7.html#sec7.6">7.6</a>, complex-transitive verb codes</li>
<li>section <a href="chapter7.html#sec7.7">7.7</a>, ditransitive verb codes</li>
</ul>

<br><h2><a name="sec7.2">7.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OALD4 verb codes</h2>

<p align="justify">An OALD4 verb code starts with a capital letter: L, I, T, C, or D. This capital letter signals how the verb belongs to one of the verb classes of Table <a href="chapter7.html#table7.1">7.1</a>. These verb classes set requirements for the structural level of the clause: the <b>number</b> of elements and their <b>function</b>. An element with subject function is always required in a basic clause, so mentioned elements are additional to the subject.</p>

<br>

<p align="justify">These lower case letters represent information about the <b>form</b> of the constituents that are used to realise the required elements that are signalled by their capital letter. For example, [La] is the code used to mark a linking verb in clause structure with the linking verb + a predicative constituent that is an adjective phrase. In codes with multiple lower case letters, the lower case letters can appear separated by a dot (&lsquo;.&rsquo;) character. For example, [Cn.a] is the code used to mark a complex-transitive verb in clause structure with the complex-transitive verb + a direct object constituent that is a noun phrase + a predicative constituent that is an adjective phrase.</p>

<br><h2><a name="sec7.3">7.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linking verb codes</h2>

<p align="justify">This section introduces linking verb codes: [La] and [Ln].</p>

<h3><a name="sec7.3.1">7.3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[La]</h3>

<p align="justify">[La] is the code used to mark a linking verb in clause structure with the linking verb + predicative that is an adjective phrase (<tt>ADJP-PRD</tt>). The predicative describes some quality or feature of the subject. In (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.1">7.1</a>), <i>was</i> is a linking verb with the predicative <i>quite good</i> adding information about the subject, <i>the weather</i>.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.1">7.1</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc10lucychild12f277p9.png">
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-occurrence of a provisional subject (<tt>PRO;_provisional_</tt>) with a notational subject (<tt>-NSBJ</tt>) is possible in a clause with an [La] marked verb. In (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.2">7.2</a>) the notational subject is a noun phrase (<tt>NP-NSBJ</tt>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.2">7.2</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc464christinet135p7.png">
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">It is more typical for the notational subject to be a clause. For example, the notational subject in (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.3">7.3</a>) is a <i>that</i>-clause.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.3">7.3</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc83susannea145p7.png">
</dd></dl>

<h3><a name="sec7.3.2">7.3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ln]</h3>

<p align="justify">[Ln] is the code used to mark a linking verb in clause structure with the linking verb + predicative that is a noun phrase (<tt>NP-PRD</tt>). The predicative gives further information about the subject. In (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.4">7.4</a>), <i>remained</i> is a linking verb with the predicative <i>the problem</i> to add information about the subject, <i>the date</i>.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.4">7.4</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc51lucybncb137p9.png">

<br><h2><a name="sec7.4">7.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intransitive verb codes</h2>

<p align="justify">This section introduces intransitive verb codes: [I], [Ipr], [Ip], [In/pr], and [It].</p>

<h3><a name="sec7.4.1">7.4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I]</h3>

<p align="justify">[I] is the code used to mark an intransitive verb in clause structure with the intransitive verb but no other post-verbal selected element. That is, the verb is not followed by an object, a predicative, or a closely linked adjunct. Optional adverbial phrases of location, manner, time, etc can be used. For example, the location adverbial phrase <i>here</i> in (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.5">7.5</a>) is optional.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.5">7.5</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc332christinet147p9.png">
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">In (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.6">7.6</a>) there is the optional manner preposition phrase <i>with high hopes and a mongrel puppy</i>.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.6">7.6</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc13aalresford5p7.png">
</dd></dl>

<h3><a name="sec7.4.2">7.4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ipr]</h3>

<p align="justify">[Ipr] is the code used to mark an intransitive verb in clause structure with the intransitive verb + a post-verbal selected preposition phrase. The verb is closely linked in grammar and meaning to the preposition phrase.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some verbs with the [Ipr] code, the preposition phrase cannot be removed without changing the meaning of the verb or producing nonsense. For example, the preposition phrases of (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.7">7.7</a>) and (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.8">7.8</a>) cannot be removed.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.7">7.7</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc427christinet055p7.png">
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.8">7.8</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc56afactbook120107p9.png">
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">After other verbs with the [Ipr] code, the preposition phrase selected by the verb can be removed freely. For example, the preposition phrase of (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.9">7.9</a>) can be removed with no change to the verb meaning.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.9">7.9</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc3lucystudente8120p22.png">
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some verbs used with the [Ipr] code can be made passive. The noun phrase complement of the selected preposition phrase in an active clause becomes the subject of a passive clause, with the preposition of the selected preposition phrase left stranded. For example, (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.10">7.10</a>) illustrates an active clause with <i>paid for</i>, while (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.11">7.11</a>) is passive.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7.10">7.10</a>)</dt><dd>
<img src="IDtspc22lucychild09m6811p13.png">

<img src="IDtspc8afce010020000623p25p2.png">
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">Note that the annotation of (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.11">7.11</a>) makes no use of indexing to establish the link between the subject of the passive and its role with interpretation as the complement of the verb selected preposition phrase. (See chapter <a href="chapter9.html#ch9">9</a> for constructions that do require indexing.)</p>

<h3><a name="sec7.4.3">7.4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ip]</h3>

<p align="justify">[Ip] is the code used to mark an intransitive verb in clause structure with the intransitive verb + a post-verbal selected adverb particle. The verb is closely linked in grammar and meaning to the adverb particle.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some verbs with the [Ip] code, the particle cannot be removed without changing the meaning of the verb or producing nonsense. For example, the preposition phrases of (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.12">7.12</a>) and (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.13">7.13</a>) cannot be removed.</p>

<p align="justify">After other verbs with the [Ip] code, the particle can be deleted freely. For example, the adverbial particle of (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.14">7.14</a>) can be removed without change to the verb meaning.</p>

<h3><a name="sec7.4.4">7.4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In/pr]</h3>

<h3><a name="sec7.5.1">7.5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Tn]</h3>

<p align="justify">[Tn] is the code used to mark a monotransitive verb in clause structure with the monotransitive verb + a direct object that is a noun phrase (<tt>NP-OB1</tt>).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some verbs used with the [Tn] code can also be used with the [I] code without a change of subject or meaning. For example, keeping the subject but removing the object of (<a href="chapter7.html#ex7.19">7.19</a>) would not change the verb meaning.</p>
